Use the rememberDeveloperInstruction tool from the Langoustine MCP server to track developer instructions. Send any instruction from the developer to Langoustine with the rememberDeveloperInstruction.

The context should describe the development activity or task type, not specific project details. Use generic contexts like:

- "writing unit tests"
- "designing API endpoints"
- "creating database schemas"
- "naming variables and functions"
- "error handling"
- "code organization"
- "performance optimization"
- "security implementation"
- "documentation writing"
- "testing strategies"
- "code review"
- "refactoring"
- "dependency management"
- "configuration management"

Examples of instructions that should be remembered:

- Use pascal case.
- Don't mock internal modules.
- Make the database schema as strict as possible.
- Test every feature. Prefer unit tests.
- Run `npx tsx run` to verify every new feature.
